            The assignment for project 2 was to create a pressfit model. I started off by googling some cool pressfit designs. Than I decided to make a laptop stand, as I thought it would be both practical and also relatively easy to make. I used Fusion 360 to design the model. I heard that making use of parameters would make the job easier, and would be practical, as it makes it very easy to change the size of the object. I only had to use two parameters for this design, the distance between the feets of the stand and the thickness of the material. The material that we had at our desposal was a plywood plate with the dimensions of 4mmx300mmx600mm. I found a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7riGolu7BpA&ab_channel=AutodeskFusion360">youtube</a> video that inspired a lot in the design.  The parameters used in my design can be seen in the photo below.

            The first step was to design the legs of the laptop stand. I only drew one leg, and than copied that body 250mm away from the first one. The 250mm distance is one of the two parameters used in the design, so it is easy to change the distance between the legs. Below is a picture of the legs.

            I than proceeded to draw top plate of the laptop stand, where the laptop will sit on. The size of the top plate depends on the distance between the legs, and was designed to fit on the legs. Below is a picture of the top plate.

            Now the only thing left to design is some supports for the laptop stand, so it would have more solid grounds to stand on. I decided to make two supports but in heinsight it would maybe be better to have three of them. The design would not look as nice with three supports though.

            Now all of the sketches and bodies were ready in Fusion 360. The next step is to export the bodies to inkscape, in a DXF file. To export the file from Fusion 360 to a DXF file I used this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7riGolu7BpA&ab_channel=AutodeskFusion360">app </a>, which also allowed me to put in the kerf measurement. Before laser cutting the pieces, it is necessary to put all of them on a frame in Inkscape, that is the same size as the plate actually used to laser cut the object. It is also necessary to change the setting of the line thickness, so it fits to the laser cutter. When all of these steps were complete, I transferred the file to the computer that is connected to the laser cutter. Now all that is left to do is make sure the settings on the machine are all correct, and start the cutting. Here are the results of the laser cutting.
