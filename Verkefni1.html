        While I watched the video I was following his tips, trying to do the same things as the instructor did. 
        The first step I took was downloading Bracket, to write my code in.

        Only now could I begin making the website. I made a few files to start of, for the front page, one for an about me page, and than another file for the page I will upload my projects. I wanted to have a top navigation bar, so that was the first thing I did. The first few lines of codes in every page is therefore the same, to keep the navigation bar in tact. I found a good tutorial on how to do a nice top navigation bar, click <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_navbar.asp"> here </a> 
        to visit the website.
