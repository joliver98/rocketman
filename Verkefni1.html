            Before I started this project I had no knowlegde about HTML coding, so I started off by watching this youtube video
            <br>
            <br>
            <iframe width="420" height="315"

            </iframe>
        <br>
        <br>
         
        While I watched the video I was following his tips, trying to do the same things as the instructor did. 
        The first step I took was downloading Bracket, to write my code in.

        Only now could I begin making the website. I made a few files to start of, for the front page, one for an about me page, and than another file for the page I will upload my projects. I wanted to have a top navigation bar, so that was the first thing I did. The first few lines of codes in every page is therefore the same, to keep the navigation bar in tact. I found a good tutorial on how to do a nice top navigation bar, click <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_navbar.asp"> here </a> 
        to visit the website.

        I decided to use the Github desktop app to publish my website, so I downloaded the app, and made a Repository name. The next step was to upload my files to github. At first it would not work as non of my working files were named index.html.
            <br>

        However after I changed a file name to index.html everything worked fine, so I assume that is a solution to that problem.
