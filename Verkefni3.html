           <h3>3D Printing</h3>
                     
            <article>
                
            The assignment for project 3 was to design a 3d model and than print it. I had 100 grams of material at my disposal so the object could not weigh more than that. I started off my using google and youtube to get some ideas see cool projects that others had designed. I decided to make an object, with the purpose of stopping wheels from moving. Below is a picture of the object. 
                   <br>

                   <br>
            The first step in the design procces was to make a simple box, and cut parts out of it until the design is complete.
             <br>

                   <br>    
                Now I drew a cirlce and used it to cut out some space 
                 
                <br>
                <center><img src="hjolfesting_hringur.JPG".JPG height="400" width="" alt="" /></center>
                   <br>
                
                <br>
                <center><img src="hjolfesting_cut_hringur.JPG" height="400" width="" alt="" /></center>
                   <br>
                 Than I made some fillets on the edges to make it look better.
                <br>
                <center><img src="hjolfesting_fillet.JPG".JPG height="400" width="" alt="" /></center>
                   <br>
            I addes some holes on the bottom of the object, to make space for non-slip rubber.
                <br>
                <center><img src="hjolfestingbotn.JPG".JPG height="400" width="" alt="" /></center>
                   <br>
            The next step was to cut some material out of the sides. 
                
                 <br>
                <center><img src="hjolfesting_cut2.JPG".JPG height="400" width="" alt="" /></center>
                   <br>
                <br>
                <center><img src="hjolfesting_hlidarcut.JPG".JPG height="400" width="" alt="" /></center>
                   <br>
                Below is a picture of the design when everything was ready. 
                 <br>
                <center><img src="hjolfesting1.JPG".JPG height="400" width="" alt="" /></center>
                   <br>
                
                Now I had to export the file in a STL format, to ultimaker cura. In ultimaker cura I prepare the object for printing. 
                 <br>

                   <br>
                As shown in the phote above, the object weighs 32 grams and takes slighly more than 6 hours to print. 
                
                Pictures of the final outcome are below.

              <h3> 3D scanning  </h3>    
                 <article>
                 Another part of project 3 was to 3d scan an object. I downloaded an app "qlone" on my iphone which makes it very easy to 3d scan an object. It is neccesary to print a paper, that is provided in the app so the scanning works. Here is a picture of the paper.  
                      <br>
                <center><img src="3dScanBla%C3%B0.jpg".JPG height="400" width="" alt="" /></center>
                   <br>
                     First I tried to scan a Skyr, but it went pretty wrong. 
                      <br>

                   <br>
                     And than I scanned a loop and it was better, altough it wasn't perfect.
