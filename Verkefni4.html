           I worked in this groupproject with my colleges 
           <a href=" https://sindrism.github.io/Framleidsluferli.github.io/index.html">Sindri Snær</a> and
           <a href="https://btk4.github.io/framleidsluferli/">Björgvin Þór</a>.
              <br>
            My role in the group was to make a video of the manufacturing process. I had no prior experience editing or making videos before this assignment so the first thing I did was to search on google for some good editing software. I chose to use VideoPad for the editing, but I didn't realise until I was into making the video that I could only export the video file for a limited amount of times. 
           <br>
           For that reason I decided to switch to the Windows video editing app, which is very easy to use. I only had to import all of my clips into the app, and than put them in a good timeline. The image below shows how the app looks when I was arranging the photos.

            <br>
            The next step was then to choose some background music for the video. I searched on Youtube for an approriate song until I found one. Than I had to convert the song from the youtube video to an mp3 file.
            I used <a href="https://ytmp3.cc/youtube-to-mp3/">this</a> website to convert it. 
           Than I imported the mp3 file to Windows video editor and put it as the background sound. The picture below shows how that is done.

            <br>
           
           Now the video was ready to be exported, and uploaded to the website. 
           
            <video width="700" height="" controls>
            <source src="myndband.mp4" type="video/mp4">
            
                    Your browser does not support the video tag. <!-- Text to be shown incase browser doesnt support html5 -->
           </video>
